### How to build

- Install `node.js` from <http://nodejs.org/download/>.
- Install `gulp` by running `npm install gulp -g`.
- Fetch `node.js` modules by running `npm install`.
- Build website by running `gulp build`.
- Or just run `gulp` to start local web server on port 8080. It should open browser automatically or type <http://localhost:8080> in your browser. There is also a shortcut to start `gulp` if you are on Windows.
